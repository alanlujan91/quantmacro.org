I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate at The Ohio State University Department of Economics. My research interest is at the intersection of credit access, educational attainment, and intergenerational mobility. In particular, I am interested in how differences in access to credit and heterogeneity in borrowing costs affect parental investment in early childhood development and later educational and labor market outcomes.
